Included in this repository are the files used in the development of my personal website hosted on Github Pages at [daverb.github.io](davidburson.me).

A small side project I undertook to give myself (yet another) online platform. I have implemented the blog aware [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) software for static site generation. This is a great option for the casual blogger who doesn't want to get bogged down in CMS/database archiving/pagination/any other unnecessary pain.
